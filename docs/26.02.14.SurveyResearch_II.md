### **Key Improvements Made:**

1. **Cleaner structure** – 8 sections vs scattered questions
2. **Digital-friendly** – All questions work in Typeform/Google Forms
3. **Investment narrative** – Questions directly map to "we know the market"
4. **Removed redundancy** – Combined similar questions
5. **Added strategic depth** – Section 6 (competitive advantage) is now more precise
6. **Better concept test** – Section 7 tests Curzon House explicitly
7. **Quantified everything possible** – Easier to visualize as charts for investors
8. **Shortened by ~15%** – More likely to be completed

**Recommended next steps:**
1. Build this in **Typeform** (best UX) or **Google Forms** (easier analysis)
2. Add conditional logic (e.g., only show "rooms" rating if they selected a club with rooms)
3. Set up **automated reporting** to generate charts for investor deck
4. Consider offering **incentive** for completion (early access to Curzon House events, founding member discount, etc.)

Would you like me to:
- Create the actual Typeform/Google Forms structure?
- Design the data visualization plan for investor presentation?
- Draft the survey invitation email?
