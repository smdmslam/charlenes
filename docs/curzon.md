Curzon Street takes its name from the Anglo‑Norman Curzon family, major landowners in the area by the early 18th century, and 30 Curzon’s “golden era” was as a grand Georgian/Edwardian social house moving from aristocratic salon to elite commercial entertaining club.wikipedia+3

Origin of the name “Curzon”





The street stands on land that passed in 1715 to Sir Nathaniel Curzon of Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire, whose family then oversaw its development from the 1720s; the street was named for him.collections.soane+1



The Curzon surname itself is Norman‑French, traced to Notre‑Dame‑de‑Curson in Calvados and to a family that arrived with William the Conqueror, later holding a major seat in Derbyshire as Lords of the Manor.houseofnames+2



Etymologically, Curzon/Curson derives from a Latin‑French root around Curtius / “Curtus” (short), typical of Norman aristocratic nicknames that then crystallised into place‑ and family‑names.surnamedb+1

Early Curzon Street lifestyle (18th–19th century)





The street began life as part of “Mayfair Row” when the surrounding fields were being transformed into one of London’s most exclusive residential quarters for the peerage, directly linked to the old May Fair at Shepherd Market.wikipedia+2



By the mid‑18th century, Curzon Street read like a peerage directory: Chesterfield House was built here for Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, and other residents included the Duke of Grafton, Lord Hothfield, Lady Blessington, Alfred de Rothschild and the Earl of Inchcape.londonforfree+2



It quickly became shorthand in literature for patrician, slightly decadent Mayfair life: Oscar Wilde and others placed characters here, and later Osbert Lancaster coined “Curzon Street Baroque” to describe the inter‑war, intellectually fashionable interiors associated with its residents.businesscube+1

30 Curzon in its aristocratic heyday





No. 30 was built around 1750–55 on the newly laid‑out Curzon estate and soon became a fully fledged London mansion rather than a simple townhouse.[collections.soane]​



In the 1770s Robert Adam was commissioned to amalgamate two houses into a single grand residence for the Hon. Henry Frederick Thynne, Postmaster General, adding a distinctive circular dining room that anchored formal entertaining.standard+1



Through the early 19th century it remained within the highest social echelon: Princess Sophia Matilda, a granddaughter of George III’s generation, lived there, which implies a household of royal visitors, levees, musicales and political dinners typical of court‑adjacent Mayfair houses.[standard.co]​

30 Curzon’s “golden era” social texture

If you zoom in on lifestyle rather than just ownership, you can read 30 Curzon’s golden era as a sequence of high‑society uses:





Georgian/Regency: as Thynne’s house and later a royal princess’s address, the circular dining room and drawing rooms would have hosted cabinet‑level political dinners, card parties and salons – the archetype of ministerial Mayfair living.standard+1



Late Victorian–Edwardian: with Henry Thomas Hare’s 1890 extension adding a ballroom and a first‑floor apse, the house tilted even harder into spectacle – full‑orchestra dances, charity balls, society weddings – the kind of programme that made Curzon Street a byword for private glamour.[standard.co]​



Early 20th century commercial‑social: when Gunter’s, the high‑society confectioner and caterer, occupied the building after their Berkeley Square era, 30 Curzon became as much a serviced entertaining hub as a private house, producing elaborate cakes and banqueting for the rich and titled.[standard.co]​

In narrative terms, the “golden era” you can mine is that arc from Adam’s 18th‑century dining room through Hare’s ballroom and Gunter’s tenure: a building whose core function for 200+ years was to stage elite sociability, from ministerial dinners to royal balls and extravagant Mayfair parties.londonforfree+2

From war to elite club (mid‑20th century onwards)





During the Second World War 30 Curzon survived with only limited bomb damage, and in the post‑war years it housed the Royal Worcester Porcelain Company, keeping a link to English decorative arts and genteel retail rather than being chopped into standard offices.[standard.co]​



In 1983 Crockfords took over the property, turning it into one of London’s most exclusive gambling clubs, so the same rooms that had seen cabinet dinners and Gunter’s wedding cakes shifted into high‑stakes gaming, private dining and members‑only late‑night hospitality.[standard.co]​



Even today, the way agents describe the building—Grade I, grand Georgian, Adam dining room, Hare ballroom—still encodes that long lifestyle story: Curzon Street as a continuous stage for high‑status gathering, with No. 30 as one of its purest expressions.wikipedia+2
