Michelin Star Restaurant Concept Questions

1. Where they actually eat lunch and dinner in Mayfair/Belgravia right now. This tells you the competitive set for the restaurant specifically, not the club. Scott's, Sexy Fish, Cipriani, The Araki, Hélène Darroze — these are the real comparables. If respondents consistently name the same 3-4 venues, that's your benchmark.
2. How they discover and book fine dining. If it's Resy and word of mouth, that's operationally different than if it's concierge-driven. For a Michelin-calibre launch, knowing the booking behaviour of your target diner matters.
3. Whether they'd dine at a private members' club restaurant if they weren't a member. Some people actively avoid club restaurants because they feel exclusionary or tired. This is a known perception problem you need to surface and either address or dismiss.
4. The "restaurant as gateway" conversion question. Have they ever become a member somewhere partly because they loved the restaurant first? This validates your public restaurant → member funnel directly.
5. Chef-as-brand vs. house-as-brand. Do they follow specific chefs, or do they return to rooms and experiences? This is actually a risk question for investors — if the answer is "chef-driven," then losing your chef creates valuation risk.
6. Wine and beverage programme. Given your own interest in wine, you'll know that at this level the wine list is often the differentiator between a good and a great restaurant. Worth testing how much this matters to your target respondent.
7. Private dining rooms. The deck shows Members' Dining Private Salons. Understanding appetite and frequency of private dining at this level tells you a lot about yield potential from that space.
Here are the questions I'd add as a new Section 3: Fine Dining & Restaurant Behaviour — positioned right after Section 2 (Clubs Evaluation) so it flows naturally before the co-working questions:

New Section 3: Fine Dining & Restaurant Behaviour

Q3.1 — Current Fine Dining Habits
Type: Multiple Choice (multi-select, max 3)
Question: Which of the following best describes how you use fine dining restaurants in London? Select your top 3.
Options:

Regular business lunches (weekly or more)
Client entertainment dinners
Celebratory / special occasion dining
Spontaneous social dinners with friends
Tasting menu / experiential dining
Private dining (room hire for group)
Weekend dining with family

Why this matters: Tells you whether your audience skews toward yield-heavy business lunches or lower-frequency but high-spend special occasions. Both are good — but they require different operations and service calibration.

Q3.2 — Mayfair/St James's Fine Dining
Type: Short Text (open)
Question: Name the 2-3 restaurants in Mayfair, St James's, or Belgravia where you dine most regularly.
Placeholder: Example: Scott's, Sexy Fish, Hélène Darroze...
Max Length: 150 characters
Required: Yes
Why this matters: Surfaces your real competitive set. If Scott's comes up 80% of the time, you know exactly who you're competing against and what standard you're being measured by.

Q3.3 — Would You Dine at a Club Restaurant?
Type: Multiple Choice
Question: How do you feel about dining at a private members' club restaurant as a non-member?
Options:

Actively seek them out — they're often excellent
Happy to if recommended, but don't seek them out
Neutral — depends entirely on the chef/reputation
Mildly deterred — feels exclusionary or awkward
Actively avoid — they rarely match standalone restaurants

Required: Yes
Why this matters: Tests a known perception risk. If 40%+ feel deterred, that's a design and communications problem to solve at launch. If most are neutral or positive, the public restaurant thesis is validated.

Q3.4 — Restaurant-to-Membership Conversion
Type: Multiple Choice
Question: Have you ever joined a club — or seriously considered joining — partly because of the quality of its restaurant?
Options:

Yes, the restaurant was a significant factor
Yes, it was a minor factor among others
No, but I could imagine it influencing me
No — restaurant quality has never been a membership driver for me

Required: Yes
Why this matters: This is the single most important question for validating the public restaurant → member funnel. If 50%+ say yes or "could imagine it," your investor thesis holds. If it's lower, you need to reframe how the restaurant is presented.

Q3.5 — Chef vs. House
Type: Multiple Choice
Question: When you return repeatedly to a restaurant, what is the PRIMARY reason?
Options:

The chef's reputation and cooking style
The room, atmosphere and sense of place
The consistency of the overall experience
The social scene and who else goes there
The wine list and beverage programme
The private dining or hosting capability

Required: Yes
Why this matters: If "chef" dominates, it flags talent-retention risk to sophisticated investors. If "room and atmosphere" dominates, it validates the Curzon House model — because the room is yours permanently, the chef is replaceable.

Q3.6 — Private Dining Frequency
Type: Multiple Choice
Question: How often do you host or attend private dining events (hired room, set menu, exclusive use)?
Options:

Monthly or more
Every 2-3 months
2-4 times per year
Once a year or less
Never

Required: Yes
Why this matters: The deck shows private salons as a distinct revenue line. This validates the frequency assumption built into your financial model.

Q3.7 — Private Dining Spend
Type: Multiple Choice
Question: What is your typical budget per head for a hosted private dining event (excluding room hire)?
Options:

Under £100
£100 – £200
£200 – £350
£350 – £500
Over £500

Required: Yes
Why this matters: Directly informs your F&B yield assumptions on the private dining line. This is the kind of number investors will ask about and you want primary data, not industry estimates.

Q3.8 — Wine Programme Importance
Type: Opinion Scale (1-10)
Question: How important is the wine and beverage programme to your overall assessment of a fine dining restaurant?
Scale: 1 (Irrelevant — I focus on food) to 10 (Critical — the list shapes my choice)
Required: Yes
Why this matters: At Michelin level, the sommelier and wine programme are major cost centres. Knowing how much your target audience values this validates or challenges that investment.

Q3.9 — Reservation Behaviour
Type: Multiple Choice
Question: How do you typically book high-end restaurant reservations?
Options:

Directly via the restaurant's website
Resy / OpenTable / similar platform
Through a hotel or club concierge
Via a personal assistant or EA
Word of mouth and direct call

Required: Yes
Why this matters: Operational — tells you where to invest in distribution. Also tells you how dependent you are on concierge networks, which is a relationship you'll need to build deliberately.

Q3.10 — Concept Validation: Restaurant Standalone
Type: Multiple Choice
Question: If Curzon House's ground-floor restaurant received strong reviews and a Michelin star, how likely would you be to book as a non-member diner?
Options:

Very likely — would book within the first month
Likely — would book within 6 months
Probably — if recommended by someone I trust
Unlikely — I have enough restaurants I already use
Very unlikely

--


Required: Yes
Why this matters: This is your conversion funnel question. If 60%+ say very likely or likely, you have a compelling lead-generation engine validated by the people you're actually trying to reach.
