2. Data Visualization Plan for Investor Presentation
Now I'll create the analysis framework and chart specifications.

DATA VISUALIZATION PLAN
A. Pre-Analysis Setup
Tools:

Typeform → Export to Google Sheets
Google Sheets → Data cleaning + pivot tables
Flourish/Datawrapper → Interactive charts for presentation
Figma/Canva → Final deck assembly

Data Structure:
RAW DATA SHEET (from Typeform export)
→ CLEANING SHEET (normalize club names, remove incomplete responses)
→ ANALYSIS SHEET (pivot tables + calculations)
→ VISUALIZATION SHEET (chart-ready data)
